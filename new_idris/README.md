# Enhanced Backend Package

This package contains your uploaded Django backend (from `backed.zip`) plus helpful scaffolding files to get the project running, package it with Docker, and add an API later. It **does not** modify your original app files — additional helper files are added at the project root so you can choose what to copy into your project.

## Files added
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies suggested for DRF, JWT, Celery, Redis, Stripe
- `.env.example` - Example environment variables (do **not** commit secrets)
- `Dockerfile` - Image to run Django with Gunicorn
- `docker-compose.yml` - Compose file for Postgres, Redis, web, worker
- `README.md` - this file
- `api_snippets/` - contains example DRF serializers/views you can drop into your app (see below).

## Where your original project is
The original uploaded project files were extracted in this package under the same directory structure you uploaded. Check the project root inside this archive for folders like `app/`, `dashboard/`, `core/` or `backend/` (depending on your repo).

## Quick steps (basic) to open & run locally WITHOUT Docker (simple development)
1. Make a Python virtualenv:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit values (especially `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`).
3. If you're using SQLite (the project already included `db.sqlite3`), you can run:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Quick steps to run with Docker (recommended for parity)
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit secrets.
2. Build and run:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
3. The web app will be at http://localhost:8000/
4. To run Django management commands inside the container:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
   docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

## API snippets (drop these into your `app/` folder if you want to add DRF)
See `api_snippets/` directory in this package. They include:
- `serializers.py` - product/category/order serializers
- `api_views.py` - example viewsets and cart endpoints
- `tasks_example.py` - example Celery task to send confirmation emails

## How to add the API snippets (basic)
1. Copy the files from `api_snippets/` to your Django app directory (e.g., `app/serializers.py`, `app/api_views.py`).
2. Add `rest_framework` and `corsheaders` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings.
3. Configure `REST_FRAMEWORK` and `SIMPLE_JWT` as shown in the snippet headers (use environment variables).
4. Wire the API router in your project `urls.py` (example provided in snippet header).

## Notes
- Do **not** commit actual `.env` with secrets to git. Use `.env.example` for sharing.
- This package **does not** automatically replace your database or modify your code — it only provides the scaffolding files and examples to help you finish the backend.
